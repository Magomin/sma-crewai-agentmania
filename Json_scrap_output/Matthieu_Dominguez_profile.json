        "The national hashtag#industrial construction pipeline keeps expanding as a result of increased warehouse space needed by retailers to store long-delayed inventories. Expansion has seen an increase of 65% in the last six quarters in comparison with the pre-pandemic times, largely triggered by companies having to hold larger inventories.Â The article mentions thatÂ reduction in customer consumption has reduced inventory pressure and companies like Target and Amazon have decided to pause expansion projects, but that is not slowing down the overall construction activities in the industrial sector. Industrial markets like Dallas, Phoenix and Atlanta seem to be under the highest pressure to prepare for more Inventory struggles. hashtag#TCC TradeCo enables US companies to have better control over their inventories.
